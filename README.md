Automated Annotation of Protein Complexes in 3D Cellular Images -Machine Learning 

Project Goal: Develop a generalizable Machine Learning (ML) algorithm to automatically annotate diverse protein complexes within 3D cellular images (cryoET tomograms). 

Why is this important? 

Understanding protein complex interactions is critical for health and developing new disease treatments. 

Cryo-electron tomography offers near-atomic detail of protein arrangements in cells. 

Analyzing large amounts of cryoET data requires automatic protein complex identification. 

This project aims to unlock hidden information ("dark matter") within cells, paving the way for numerous discoveries. 

Project Scope: 

Focus on developing and training ML algorithms for five specific classes of protein complexes in a curated real-world cryoET dataset. 

The goal is a generalizable solution, meaning the algorithm should be adaptable to identify other protein complexes beyond the initial five classes. 

Project Deliverables: 

A trained ML model capable of accurately annotating protein complexes within cryoET tomograms. 

Performance metrics demonstrating the model's accuracy for each protein complex class. 

Documentation outlining the model architecture, training process, and potential future applications. 

Ideation for ML Approaches: 

Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are strong candidates for image recognition tasks. 3D CNNs can be explored to analyze the volumetric data of cryoET tomograms. 

Transfer Learning: Leverage pre-trained models on similar image recognition tasks for faster convergence and improved performance. 

Data Augmentation: Artificially increase the size and diversity of the training dataset by generating variations of existing tomograms (rotation, flips, noise injection). 

Project Phases: 

Data Preprocessing:  

Download and curate cryoET tomogram data with corresponding protein complex annotations. 

Preprocess the data for ML usage, including normalization and augmentation. 

Model Development:  

Design and implement the chosen ML architecture (e.g., 3D CNN). 

Experiment with hyperparameter tuning and different training methods. 

Model Training and Evaluation:  

Train the ML model on the prepared dataset. 

Evaluate model performance on a separate validation set using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall for each protein class. 

Refinement and Generalization:  

Refine the model based on evaluation results to improve performance. 

Test the model's generalizability on unseen cryoET tomograms. 

Documentation and Sharing:  

Document the project methodology, model architecture, and results. 

Consider sharing the model and code for further research and development. 

Competition Considerations: 

Familiarize yourself with the specific competition format and evaluation criteria. 

Explore existing literature and resources on protein complex annotation with ML. 

Consider collaborating with biologists or experts in cryoET to gain deeper understanding of the data and biological context. 

Conclusion: 

Developing a robust ML algorithm for protein complex annotation is a challenging but impactful project. By focusing on a well-defined scope, exploring different ML approaches, and carefully iterating, this project can contribute significantly to accelerating discoveries in biomedical science.
